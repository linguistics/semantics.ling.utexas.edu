      processor and a dictionary of grammatical, psychological, and content categories in English.
      Dictionaries with grammatical, psychological, and content categories have been developed in
      other languages for use with LIWC. Modern Standard Arabic LIWC dictionaries were
      completed. Chinese, French, Persian, Russian, and Turkish LIWC dictionaries are in various
      stages of development.
